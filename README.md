# CompressPictures
Shrinks the size of pictures

Copied from [post](https://shantanujoshi.github.io/python-image-compression/) but unable to fork for some reason.

Current process
* Place image files in same directory as compress.py
* new images are created with a "compressed_" added in the same directory

Things to add
* would like this to go to specific directories and also create those directories if they do not exists
    * Original Directory
    * Comprssed Directory
* Maybe not change the name??
* Do a check to make sure it is under 1 mb? 
* add a .gitignore to ignore the files in those folders
